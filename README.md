# Login with me

This is a practice at [Patika.dev](https://app.patika.dev/moduller/java101/pratik-login-1)

This program will check the username and password with conditional statements. If password is correct it will print 
"**Successful login**". If password is wrong, 
user will be asked to reset the password. If user decides to change password, it will check the new password
with old one. If passwords are same, it will give a message that states the new password cannot be same with old one.
If old and new passwords are not same it will give a message that is "**New password is created**"

Default username and password is "*admin*" and "*qwe123*" respectively.
